# Movie Lib

This is a react project that I created following the tutorial video from [Matheus Battisti's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqxUHVVO7-U). This is a simple 3 screens project, where movies with the best review rates on [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) are displayed as movie cards, and the user is able to click on each of them in case he/she wants to see more details about it. It is also possible to search for a specific movie using the search bar placed on the navbar on the top.

The content is retrievied from API calls to the TMDB API.

On this project, we could apply and learn different React tools, such as the [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/). I also learned how to start a SPA Reac project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Lastly, I could reinforce some past learnings about React Hooks like useState and useEffect.
